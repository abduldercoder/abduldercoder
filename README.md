## ✨ University & CS50 Projects

Hey—I'm G, an informatics student and curious builder who loves turning theory into 🔥code. Below are the projects that keep my caffeine budget high and my GitHub commit graph green. Dive in, drop a ⭐, or fork away!

| Project | TL;DR | Tech Stack | What I Learned / Future Plans |
|---------|-------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| **ADS-Set (Separate Chaining)** | Custom hash-table based `Set<T>` with linked-list buckets for collision control. Fast 🏎️ lookups, clean API. | C++17 · GoogleTest · Valgrind | – Tuning load factors & resizing<br>– Memory-safe pointer gymnastics<br>**Next:** swap in open addressing + benchmarking |
| **Vector Class** | From-scratch `Vector<T>` that mirrors the STL API (iterators, `push_back`, move semantics). Think “std::vector, but mine”. | Modern C++ · Catch2 · Sanitizers | – Rule of 5 mastery<br>– Template metaprogramming basics<br>**Next:** grow-policy experimentation & SIMD speed-ups |
| **Hogwarts Legacy (Uni Mini-Game)** | A 2D wizard-duel prototype inspired by the franchise—spell casting, health bars, and a tile-map castle. | C++ · SDL2 · Tiled Maps | – Entity-component design<br>– Asset pipelines<br>**Next:** multiplayer over WebRTC + new spells |
| **🤖 CS50 Final: AI Chatbot** | Production-ready chat app built with Flask + DialoGPT. Stores convos in SQLite, serves snappy replies via Hugging Face. Full README ➡️ `/cs50-final-chatbot`. | Python · Flask · transformers · SQLite | – Async request handling<br>– Context management<br>– Securing env vars<br>**Next:** fine-tuned Llama 3 + user auth |
| **CS50 Intro Psets** | Classic CS50 problem sets re-implemented with extra commentary & unit tests. | C · Python | – Low-level debugging magic |
| **CS50 Web Course Labs (in progress)** | All labs for Harvard’s Web course—think Flask, SQL, JS, and UX polish. | Python · JS · HTML/CSS · Bootstrap | – RESTful patterns<br>– Jinja templating<br>– Accessibility 📈 |

### 🌟 Why These Projects Matter
1. **Real-world practice:** They’re my sandbox for algorithms, data structures, and full-stack chops.
2. **Continuous improvement:** Expect new branches and perf tweaks—PRs welcome!
3. **Portfolio proof:** Each repo showcases a different pillar of software engineering, from memory management to AI deployment.
